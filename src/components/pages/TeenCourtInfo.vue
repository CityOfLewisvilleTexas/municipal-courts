                <h2>What is Teen Court?</h2>
                <p>Teen Court is an alternative, voluntary program which offers young offenders an opportunity to make restitution for an offense through community service, specialized classes and jury service. By bringing the teens before a jury of their peers, Teen Court seeks to deter future unlawful behavior while providing direct experience with the court system and a greater understanding of their future role as productive citizens.  Instead of paying a fine, the teen is sentenced to constructive service in a community service organization and jury duty in the Teen Court. Other non-monetary sanctions are also possible. Upon successful completion, the case is dismissed thus avoiding the fine and keeping the teenâ€™s record clear.</p>
