        <h1 class="my-3">Alternatives to Trial</h1>
        <h2>Pleas</h2>
        <p>Under our American system of justice, all persons are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. On a plea of not guilty, a formal trial is held. As in all criminal trials, the State is required to prove the guilt of the defendant "beyond a reasonable doubt" of the offense charged in the complaint before a defendant can be found guilty by a judge or jury. </p>

        <p>Your decision concerning which plea to enter is very important. Please consider each plea carefully before making a decision. If you plead "Guilty" or "Nolo Contendere" in open court, you should be prepared to pay the fine and court costs immediately. You should contact the court clerk's office regarding how to make payment. </p>
        <v-container>
            <h2 class="mt-3">Plea of Guilty</h2>
            <p>By a plea of Guilty, you admit that the act is prohibited by law, that you committed the act charged, and that you have no defense or excuse for your act. Before entering your plea of Guilty you should understand the following: </p>

            <ol>
                <li clas="my-1">The State has the burden of proving that you violated the law (the law does not require that you prove you did not violate the law);</li>
                <li clas="my-1">You have the right to hear the State’s evidence and to require the State to prove you violated the law; and</li>
                <li clas="my-1">A plea of Guilty may be used against you later in a civil suit if there was a traffic accident (another party can say you were at fault or responsible for the accident because you pled guilty to the traffic charge).</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="mt-3">Plea of Nolo Contendere or No Contest</h2>
            <p>A plea of No Contest means that you do not contest the State’s charge against you. You will almost certainly be found guilty, unless you are eligible and successfully complete a driving safety course and/or court-ordered probation. A plea of No Contest cannot be used against you in a subsequent civil suit. </p>

            <h2 class="mt-3">Plea of Not Guilty</h2>
            <p>A plea of Not Guilty means that you are informing the court that you deny guilt or that you have a defense in your case and that the State must prove what it has charged against you. If you plead not guilty, you will need to decide whether to hire an attorney to represent you. If you represent yourself, please see the section on Trial Procedures to help you better understand the trial process. </p>

            <p>If you are convicted of a misdemeanor offense involving violence where you are or were a spouse, intimate partner, parent, or guardian of the victim or are or were involved in another similar relationship with the victim, it may be unlawful for you to possess or purchase a firearm, including a hand gun or long gun, or ammunition, pursuant to federal law under 18 U.S.C. Section 922 (g)(9) or section 46.04(b). Texas Penal Code. If you have any questions whether these laws make it illegal for you to possess or purchase a firearm, you should consult an attorney.

    <h2>Deferred Disposition</h2>
        <v-container>
            <h2>Deferred Disposition (Probation)</h2>
            <p>The court has the discretion to "defer" or postpone the disposition of your case and place you on probation for a specified period of time during which you must comply with certain terms and conditions. If you comply with those terms and conditions, the case is dismissed and no conviction is reported on your record.</p>
            
            <p>You may request Deferred Disposition prior to the trial of your case. You must enter a plea of guilty or no contest, pay a special expense fee (usually equal to the amount of the fine), commit no other offenses during the probation period, and comply with any other terms and/or conditions of probation. Successful completion of Deferred Disposition will result in the dismissal of the citation. The special fee is due at the time the request is made. NOTE: If you hold a Commercial Driver's License (CDL), you are not eligible for Deferred Disposition. </p>

            <p>You are eligible for Deferred Disposition if:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="my-1">You have not been granted Deferred Disposition in Lewisville within the past 12 months; and</li>
                <li class="my-1">You are not currently on Deferred Disposition in some other jurisdiction.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="my-2">By signing the Deferred Disposition Agreement, you are attesting that the above conditions are correct. False statements to the Court will be considered perjury and referred to the Denton County District Attorney's office for prosecution.</p>

        <h2>Driving Safety Course</h2>
        <v-container>
            <p>If you are charged with a moving violation under Subtitle C of the Texas Transportation Code, you may ask the Judge before the appearance date on the citation, either orally or in writing, to take a driving safety course. NOTE: If you hold a Commercial Driver's License (CDL), you are not eligible for the Driving Safety Course.</p>

            <p>Do not take a driving safety course without first obtaining permission from the court.</p>

            <p>If you were operating a motorcycle and request to take a driving safety course, you must take a motorcycle operator’s training course. At the time of the request, you must:
            </p>

            <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                <li class="my-1">present proof of financial responsibility (liability insurance); </li>
                <li class="my-1">present a valid Texas driver's license; </li>
                <li class="my-1">plead guilty or no contest;</li> 
                <li class="my-1">pay the courts costs and an administration fee (for moving violation offenses: $113 or $138 if in a school zone </li>
                <li class="my-1">sign an affidavit swearing that you are eligible to take a driving safety course.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You are eligible to request this course if you:</p>
            <ol class="my-3">
                <li class="my-1">have not completed a driving safety course for dismissal of a traffic offense within the 12 months preceding the date of the offense; 
                <li class="my-1">are not currently taking the course for another traffic violation; 
                <li class="my-1">have not committed the offense of speeding 25 mph or over the posted speed limit; and 
                <li class="my-1">have not committed one of the following offenses:</li>
                <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                    <li class="my-1">failure to give information at an accident scene;</li>
                    <li class="my-1">leaving the scene of an accident;</li>
                    <li class="my-1">fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer;</li>
                    <li class="my-1">reckless driving;</li>
                    <li class="my-1">passing a school bus; or</li>
                    <li class="my-1">a serious traffic violation as defined under Chapter 522, Transportation Code, which applies to drivers with commercial driver's licenses.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you have been approved by the court, you have 90 days to complete and provide a certificate of completion to the court.   The Driving Safety Course provider must be approved by the Texas Education Agency and the course may be taken either online, in a classroom setting, or by video/DVD. You must also provide to the court a certified copy of your driving record as maintained by the Texas Department of Public Safety. If you fail to comply with these conditions, you will receive notice of a Show Cause hearing requiring you to return to court and explain why you failed to show proof of completion. If you have a good reason why you were unable to present your proof within 90 days, the Judge may, but is not required to, grant you an extension. </p>

            <p>Below is a link to download an application to request a copy of your driving record. Please follow the instructions on the application.</p>
