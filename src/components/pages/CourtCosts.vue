        <h1 class="pt-3">Fines/Court Costs</h1>
         <p>The facts and circumstances of each case determine the amount of fine the court assesses. Mitigating circumstances may lower the fine, even if you are guilty. On the other hand, aggravating circumstances may increase the fine. The range of punishment or fine for most municipal court violations is as follows:</p>

            <ul class="my-4">
                <li class="my-1">Traffic Code Violations $1 - $200</li>
                <li class="my-1">Class C Penal Code Violations $1 - $500</li>
                <li class="my-1">Certain City Ordinance Violations $1 - $2,000</li>
                <li class="my-1">Other City Ordinance Violations $1 - $200</li>
                <li class="my-1">The fine does not include court costs which will usually be $68, but may be as little as $16 (Parking) to more than $100 (Insurance Violations). You will be expected to pay your fine and court costs at the time your case is heard. State law requires an additional $25 be added to each case for any fine not paid within 30 days of disposition. Further, an additional $25 will be added to any offense occurring in a school zone.</li>
            </ul>
        <p><b>Please be aware that personal checks are not accepted in payment of active warrants. Visa, Mastercard, cash or money orders are the only methods of payment accepted to clear the warrant.</b></p>

        <p>Be aware that the payment of a fine results in the waiver of your right to a jury trial, a finding of "guilty", and the entry of a conviction. </p>

        <h2 class="my-3">Payment Plan:</h2>
        <p>If you are unable to pay your fine in full and wish to make multiple payments over time, you must request to do so in person at the Court Clerk's window. An additional administrative fee of $25 will be added to the amount of the fine for setting up a time payment plan. To qualify for a payment plan, you must: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Enter a plea of guilty or no contest or be found guilty after a trial;</li>
            <li>Furnish information regarding your financial circumstances at the time you make your request for a payment plan;</li>
            <li>Pay an initial minimum payment of $50.00 and monthly payments will be calculated based on your balance;</li>
            <li>Appear in court at a specific date and time if you fail to pay on time and in the amounts ordered.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>It is your responsibility to keep track of and maintain a record of your payments. Failure to pay on time and/or to appear in court when ordered may result in the issuance of a warrant for your arrest. The payment plan option does not in any way release you from your responsibility to pay the entire fine due. </p>

        <p>Please note that if you request and are granted a payment plan to pay your fine(s), you are waiving your right to a trial, and you forfeit the options of Driving Safety Course, Deferred Adjudication or Teen Court.
